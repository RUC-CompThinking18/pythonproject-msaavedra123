# Comments
Comments were generally descriptive and gave a sense of both the why and the what of your code.

# Code Quality
I thought you had a really great solution to the issue of how to ask questions repeatedly without typing the same thing over and over. I was sending people toward using functions and classes (which for some was the better solution), but for a simple question and answer setup yours was a great solution: simple and elegant.

# Ambition
I really like the animating ideas behind this project, and the statistics you chose were appropriately shocking. I do wish that there had been a little more interaction to it and just a bit more, generally: once you've walked a "player" through those statistics, what would you like them to do?
