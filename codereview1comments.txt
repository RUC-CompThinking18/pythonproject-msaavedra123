Really good documentation of this project so far. You're off to a good start on the project. I would encourage you, rather than making a separate function for each of the questions, to have a single function that can call the questions one by one. This is going to leave you with less code to write overall and less room for error. If you'd like to see a model for how to do this, look at Nitan's project in class tomorrow, and I can walk you through the pattern I showed to him.
